## About Me

I’m a vet and the largest part of my professional practice was connected with veterinary medicine of small animals like dogs and cats. I love animals but don't want to be a vet anymore. That’s why I decided to **change my career**.

**My goal** is to become a Junior Front-End Developer. It’s an absolutely new area for me, but **I’m highly motivated to learn and to work hard** because it’s really interesting for me.

It’s important for me to do my work **with high quality** and **in time**.

I think I will work well in a team because my friends and colleagues say that I'm a **friendly** and **responsible** person.
